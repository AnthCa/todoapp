# Todo App

This is my first attempt to react, and I'm starting with basic project to learn fundamentals at React such as useState, useEffect, props and other related concepts.

## Challenge

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Toggle light and dark mode
- Message ui when you complete all tasks
